            <h2 id="about_header"> About Me </h2>
            <p> 
                I am a National Library of Medicine Postdoctoral Fellow in Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education at the University of Washington School of Medicine. My postdoc research, in collaboration with Dr. Wanda Pratt, explores how to translate accessible technology into healthcare contexts. I am currently investigating generative AI as an accessibility and design aid for people with chronic health conditions. I graduated with my PhD in Human Centered Design and Engineering from the University of Washington in 2024. My dissertation research, advised by Dr. Leah Findlater, focused on how captioning technologies could be redesigned to support hearing and d/Deaf and hard of hearing communication partners in co-creating access. As AI-generated captions increasingly replace human-generated captions, my research emphasizes how mixed hearing ability groups can collaborate with technical systems to increase accessibility.

                Broadly, I am interested in what new kinds of, applications for, ways of understanding technology emerge when research is rooted in disability community knowledge. I use a range of qualitative and design methods to do interdisciplinary technology research. My ultimate goal is to be tenure-track faculty supervising PhD students in an information school or interdisciplinary department.
