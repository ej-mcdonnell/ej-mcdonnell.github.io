            <p> 
                I am a third year Ph.D. student in Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Dr. Leah Findlater. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science at Northwestern University. My research focuses on accessible technology and I am currently interested in how technology could encourage groups to adopt more accessible communication norms.

                          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to convert their daily work lives to a “virtual” format where everyone connected remotely from their home, which affected the accessibility of work environments. We the authors, full time and intern members of an accessibility-focused team at Microsoft Research, reflect on our virtual work experiences as a team consisting of members with a variety of abilities, positions, and seniority during the summer intern season. We reflect on our summer experiences, noting the successful strategies we used to promote access and the areas in which we could have further improved access.</p>

                          <p>Accessibility research has grown substantially in the past few decades, yet there has been no literature review of the field. To  understand current and historical trends, we created and analyzed a dataset of accessibility papers appearing at CHI and ASSETS since ASSETS’ founding in 1994. Our findings highlight  areas that have received disproportionate attention and those that are underserved— for example, over 43% of papers in the past  10 years are on accessibility for blind and low vision people. We also capture common study characteristics, such as the roles of  disabled and nondisabled participants as well as sample sizes (e.g., a median of 13 for participant groups with disabilities and  older adults). We close by critically reflecting on gaps in the literature and offering guidance for future work in the field. </p>

                          <p>Social media platforms support the sharing of written text, video, and audio. All of these formats may be inaccessible to people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing and use sign language: Deaf signers. We study how Deaf signers engage with social platforms, focusing on how they share content and the barriers they face. We employ a mixed-methods approach involving seven in-depth interviews and a survey of a larger population (n = 60). We find that Deaf signers share the most in written English, despite their desire to share in sign language. We further identify key areas of difficulty in consuming content (e.g., lack of captions for spoken content in videos) and producing content (e.g., captioning signed videos, signing into a phone camera) on social media platforms. Our results reveal potential ways to make social media platforms more accessible to Deaf signers. </p>
